# The 5 Superior Cats in Movies, TV, and Literature:
## ~~Objectively True~~ My personal opinion
1. Jonsey - *Alien*
*Jonsey the cat and Ellen Ripley were the only surviving members of the USCSS Nostromo. After Riley's subsequent death within the series, Jonsey the cat remained as the only character within the Alien franchise to die of (presumably) natural causes*
